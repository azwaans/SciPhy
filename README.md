# SciPhy - Sequential Cas-9 Insertion based Phylogenetics in BEAST2

In this repository, we develop a BEAST 2 package to estimate time-scaled lineage trees and cell population dynamics from ordered Cas9-mediated insertion data.

This package was initially developed for the analysis of datasets generated with DNA Typewriter lineage tracing constructs, as described [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04922-8).

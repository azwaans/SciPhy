SciPhy
-------

SciPhy (Sequential Cas-9 Insertion based Phylogenetics) is a [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org/) package to estimate time-scaled lineage trees and cell population dynamics from ordered Cas9-mediated insertion data. This package is designed to handle any alignment of such order-aware insertion/prime-editing based lineage tracing constructs, such as: 
- DNA Typewriter lineage tracing constructs, as described [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04922-8).
- peCHYRON, as described [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.05.467507).

The preprint describing the model SciPhy and its applications can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.01.615771).

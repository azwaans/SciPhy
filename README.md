# SciPhy package

In this repository, we develop a BEAST 2 package to estimate time-scaled trees and cell population dynamics from ordered Cas9-mediated insert data.

This package was initially developed for the analysis of datasets generated with DNA Typewriter lineage tracing constructs, as described in [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04922-8).
